# Create Discora

**Create Discora** is a CLI tool designed to quickly set up a Discord bot using pre-defined templates. It streamlines the initial setup process by cloning templates from GitHub and installing the necessary dependencies.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (version 16.x or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** (to clone templates from GitHub)

## Installation

You can create a new Discord bot project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-discora@latest
```

## Usage

1. Run the command to start the setup:
   ```bash
   npx create-discora@latest
   ```
   
2. Follow the prompts to specify your project directory and select a template (TypeScript or JavaScript).

3. After the setup completes, navigate to your project directory and start your bot:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-directory
   npm run dev
   ```

## Next Steps

Once your bot is running, customize it to meet your needs. Check the template documentation for further guidance.
